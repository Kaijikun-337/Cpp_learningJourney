# Week 2

## Day 1:
* First day of the second week was really easy to soak in, because I covered templates in C++. Their huge benefit is that they can be used as blueprints for creating the same function but with different data types from int to double. It reminds me of method overloading, yet advanced one.

## Day 2 and 3:
* On both of these days, I tried to use template in different ways. Nothing new or too fancy, simple template used with vector and template as a class.

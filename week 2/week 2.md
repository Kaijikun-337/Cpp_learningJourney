# Week 2

## Day 1:
* First day of the second week was really easy to soak in, because I covered templates in C++. Their huge benefit is that they can be used as blueprints for creating the same function but with different data types from int to double. It reminds me of method overloading, yet advanced one.

## Day 2 and 3:
* On both of these days, I tried to use template in different ways. Nothing new or too fancy, simple template used with vector and template as a class.

## Day 4:
* On this day I did final boss of template topic and implemented a class that resembles some built-in methods of vector.

## Day 5:
* Today I discovered an algorithm library of C++. And learned that there are lambda functions in C++ just like in Python. Long story short, lambda functions are like the regular ones but they're more concise with three brackets needed to create it. [] for capturing the variable outside of the lambda, () arguments, {} the action of the lambda. Meanwhile, transform is for applying some operations on each element of array/vector or even arrays/vectors (it can take more than one) and pass the result to another array/vector.

## Day 6:
* On this day, I coded a small task that shows how capturing is happeneing. Although, it looks very messy it can be seen that this lambda function has a simple if else check. By the way, as you can see there's a new built-in method of algorithm library for_each its name describes what it does, it applies some operations on each element of array/vector just like transform from previous day, yet it changes the vector you provided it with, so no passing the result into other array/vector.

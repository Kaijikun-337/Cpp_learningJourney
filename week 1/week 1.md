# This folder for first week's assignments 

## Day 1:
On the first day I distinguished the difference between capacity and size. In Capacity Experiment.cpp you can see the code that detects both capacity and size changes.
* Size: is for the elements that are currently in the vector
* Capacity: is allocation of memory. 

## Day 2:
On the second day I learned about map, but as it turned out under the hood it's just the Red-Black Tree which balances itself and is good in sorting the elements. Though the average time complexity is impressive, it's O(log(n)). While other binary trees are just O(n)
* Map: is Red-Black tree under the hood. Good at sorting
